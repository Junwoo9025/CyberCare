# CyberCare

CyberCare, a free-to-install web browser extension developed using JavaScript, is designed to safeguard inexperienced Internet users, specifically targeting senior citizens. This project not only protects users from phishing attacks and dangerous websites but also educates them on responsible browsing practices. By continuously analyzing the user's browsing habits and leveraging real-time threat databases, CyberCare identifies and mitigates risks. In an age where cyber threats are continually evolving, CyberCare serves as a vital tool for promoting secure and informed online experiences. Additionally, CyberCare utilizes AWS EC2 for server maintenance and AWS RDS for PostgreSQL database management.
